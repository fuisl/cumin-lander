# First attempt report

This is the

## Materials

- Brass rod has been cut down to brass wire and then use a drill to straighten it to a rod, so we save about 50k.
- The brass rod straighten by this method isn't actually straight, but it is good enough for our purpose.
- We dont need a brass plate for the legs part, we make brass ring with a tri connection.
- We use Xiao Seeed studio nrf52840 as recommended, which is a very small, but not so cheap. We figured out that there are other variants of the nrf52840 that are cheaper, but we are not sure if they are compatible with the code.
- For the sensors, we use standard BME280, costs about 100k. Amazing performance, high accuracy, low power consumption, and small size.
- We used the drill which has no speed control. The rod usually breaks.

## Coding

- When they go low, we go low-er. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Low means high and high means low. I don't know how to explain it, but it is a fact. Ohio momment fr
- The code didn't work from the beginning when we tested the whole components on the breadboard. But we has mistakenly thought that the code was broken. Turns out the connection between the Xiao Seed and the breadboard was the problem.
- typing cat is a cool feature
- We haven't customized the code yet (since the last sculpture was fucked)

## The sculpture

1. The frame was ease to made, but I didn't account for the joint, and was too careless about precision so the frame turned out to be kinda bent. Since the wire is 0.8mm OD the, it get heated very quick to the point a solder joint far from the working one get melted and it was frustrating af.
